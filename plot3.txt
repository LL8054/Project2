## Assumes you have downloaded and extracted the data from 
## https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip
## and that the extracted files ("summarySCC_PM25.rds" and "Source_Classification_code.rds")
## are in your R working directory. 

## Answers question 3 by producing a PNG plot (Q3.png) to the working directory.  
## Question 3:
## Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, 
## which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? 
## Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a 
## plot answer this question.

## Reads the files into R

## Source types which have increased in PM2.5 Emissions from 1999 - 2008 include: Point.
## Source types which have decreased in PM2.5 Emissions from 1999 - 2008 include:  Nonpoint, Nonroad, and Onroad.
