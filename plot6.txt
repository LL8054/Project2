## Assumes you have downloaded and extracted the data from 
## https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip
## and that the extracted files ("summarySCC_PM25.rds" and "Source_Classification_code.rds")
## are in your R working directory. 

## Answers question 6 by producing a PNG plot (Q6.png) to the working directory.  
## Question 6:
## Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in 
## Los Angeles County, California (fips == 06037). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle 
## emissions? Upload a PNG file containing your plot addressing this question.

## Note:  'motor vehicle sources', for the purpose of this exercise, is defined as anything that has a motor
##         and is used for transportation.

## Reads the files into R
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

## Subsets SCC data frame into Mobile Vehicle Related data
SCCs <- SCC[grep("*Mobile*", SCC$EI.Sector),]

## Subsets NEI data frame into Vehicle related data. 
cf <- NEI[which(NEI$SCC %in% SCCs$SCC),]
af <- NEI[which(NEI$SCC %in% SCCs$SCC),]

## Subsets Vehicle related data frame further into Baltimore City, MD data and Los Angeles Count, CA. 
cf <- subset(cf, cf$fips == "24510")  ##Baltimore City subset
af <- subset(af, af$fips == "06037")  ##LA County subset

## Combines Balt City and LA County subsets
df <- rbind(cf, af)

## Replaces fips with places names
df$fips <- gsub("24510", "BC", df$fips)
df$fips <- gsub("06037", "LA", df$fips)
df$fips <- as.factor(df$fips)

## Creates stacked bar plot by groups and sends to PNG
png ("Q6.png", width=700, height=700)
plot <- ggplot() + geom_bar(data=df, aes(y = Emissions, x = fips, fill = type), stat="identity",position='stack') 
plot <- plot + theme_bw() + facet_grid( ~ year) 
plot <- plot + labs(title = "Motor Vehicle Emissions, Baltimore City, MD vs Los Angeles County, CA", 
                    x = "", y = "PM2.5") 
plot <- plot + labs(color = "Source Type")
print(plot)
dev.off()

## LA County's total PM2.5 Emissions have increased from 1999 to 2008, although the 2008 totals are down from 2005.
## Baltimore City's total PM 2.5 Emissions have decreased during that same period, though total emissions in 2008
## are up from 2005.  LA County's total Emissions are higher than Baltimore City's each year by many magnitudes. 
## Whereas Baltimore City has managed to significantly decrease their on-road emissions since 1999, LA County has ## not. Hence the answer to the question of which city has seen the most change over this period is Baltimore City.
